      Giant kelp forests produce a dense floating canopy that is clearly visible on Landsat satellite imagery. 
      Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery is freely available to the public and provides global coverage every ~16 days from 1984-present. 
      By providing classifications of changes in kelp canopy cover over the past 30 years on global scales, this project will identify regions where kelp forests have experience significant long-term changes. 
      We will then identify the likely environmental and anthropogenic drivers of these observed changes.

        Welcome to Floating Forests, where we ask you to help us uncover the history of Giant Kelp forests around the globe. Most algae and animals that live on the seafloor can only be sampled by SCUBA divers or dredging up samples from the deep. This kind of data requires a ton of (really fun) effort to collect, but it means we’re limited in our knowledge of changes in their abundances through time. But Giant Kelp is amazing - it can grow up to a foot a day and forms lush canopies that can be seen by some of the earliest satellites man put into space!

        Quite simply, kelp! Giant Kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera)! The canopy of these floating forests will show up in pictures as clusters of green pixels fringing the coastline (see image at right). Simply outline these forest canopies, and we’ll take it from there. We also hope that as you go through these pictures, you begin to see how coastlines of different areas around the world have changed over time.

      whyImportant: "Why is kelp important?"
      whyImportantP: """
      Kelp is what we call a ‘foundation species’. In ecosystems where it is present (roughly 25% of the world’s coastlines!) it is the foundation of the entire ecosystem. It provides food for all manner of herbivores from tiny shrimp to ravenous sea urchins to grazing fish. Speaking of fish, it provides habitat and hiding places for fish and other organisms on the seafloor. It can dampen coastal waves as they sweep in towards shore. And it provides alginate and other ingredients that we find in many household products from cosmetics to ice cream.
      Loss of kelp forests can have dire consequences for the health, resilience, and productivity of our coastal ecosystems.

        The images you’re looking at come from Landsat images taken every 16 days from 1984 to the present. When one of our project scientists first began working with these images, he had hoped he could just throw the hundreds of thousands of images into some image classification software, and have the software tell him where kelp was located. There’s just one problem:
        <br>
        Kelp is tricky.
        <br>
        Landsat was not designed to be able to see kelp. Kelp’s reflectance signature is just at the edge of its detection abilities. Because of this, kelp and something as simple as the glint of sun off of a wave look the same to a computer. But to a person, the shapes and patterns of kelp forests are fairly obvious. That’s where you come in.

      whatLearn: "What will we learn about kelp?"
      whatLearnP: """
      There is currently no long-term data on kelp canopy changes for most of the globe, so obtaining reliable classifications for any region (South Africa, Tasmania, New Zealand), would be a substantial improvement over our current data. Our ultimate goal would be to obtain global coverage over the entire Landsat time series (1984-present). This time period encompasses vast changes in ocean climate, coastal land-use, and human use of the sea around us.
      <br>
      By providing classifications of changes in kelp canopy cover over the past 30 years on global scales, this project will identify regions where kelp forests have experience significant long-term changes. We will then identify the likely environmental and human drivers of these observed changes.

        Well, first off, you might see *other* kelps. Some of the images we’ve included are from areas with both giant and other canopy forming kelps. To date, no one has looked at these pictures, and we really don’t know if we can use Landsat to count these other kelps, too. You might see debris lines, large ships, oil rigs, and many other interesting things. You’ll also see what areas of the coast look like around the world. Take a gander at the patterns of human habitation along developed coastline of California. Or look for interesting features on the islands just to the north of Antarctica. What do you see? Are there patterns relating to kelp? Is there something that intrigues you? Head on over to Talk and let us know about it.
